The StreetDrone Renault Twizy utilizes various software components to enable autonomous driving capabilities and facilitate research and development tasks. This documentation outlines the software setup and configuration procedures required to operate the Twizy effectively.

### Operating System Configuration

The Twizy runs on Ubuntu, a popular Linux distribution known for its stability and compatibility with a wide range of software frameworks. Follow these steps to configure the operating system environment:

1. **Ubuntu Installation**: Install Ubuntu Desktop on the Twizy by following the instructions provided in the [Ubuntu installation guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop).

2. **System Updates**: After installation, ensure that the system is up to date by running the following commands:
   
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

### Docker Installation

Docker is utilized for containerization, enabling easy deployment and management of software packages and dependencies. Refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) for instructions on installing Docker on the Twizy.

After installing Docker, follow the post-installation steps outlined in the [Docker post-installation documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) to ensure proper configuration, including adding your user to the Docker group.

### CAN Bus Configuration

The Twizy utilizes Controller Area Network (CAN) for communication between various onboard systems. To automate the CAN bus configuration process on startup, we'll create a systemd service. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a systemd Service File**: Open a terminal and create a new systemd service file:

    ```
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/can-bus-config.service
    ```

2. **Add the following content to the file**:

    ```plaintext
    [Unit]
    Description=Configure CAN Bus Interfaces
    After=syslog.target network.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=oneshot
    ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'sudo modprobe peak_usb && sudo ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000 && sudo ip link set can1 up type can bitrate 500000'
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

   This script loads the required kernel module and sets up the CAN interfaces with the desired bitrate.

3. **Save and Close the File**

4. **Reload systemd**: After creating the service file, reload systemd to apply the changes:

    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

5. **Enable the Service**: Enable the service to start automatically on boot:

    ```
    sudo systemctl enable can-bus-config.service
    ```

6. **Start the Service**: You can start the service immediately with:

    ```
    sudo systemctl start can-bus-config.service
    ```

Now, the systemd service will ensure that the required kernel modules are loaded and the CAN interfaces are set up with the desired bitrate every time you turn on your PC.
