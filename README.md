# AIR Docs Repository

Welcome to the docs repository for our research group! This repository contains documentation and resources for our projects and experiments.

## Getting Started

To get started with our projects, the minimum you'll need to have installed on your system is Docker.

üê≥ Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that contain everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.

Follow the installation instructions below based on your operating system:

### For Linux Users

If you're using Linux, you can install Docker using the following steps:

1. Follow the instructions provided [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/) to install Docker on your Linux distribution.

### For Windows Users

If you're using Windows, you'll need to install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and Docker Desktop:

1. Install WSL by following the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
2. After installing WSL, install Docker Desktop by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/).

### Optional: For Users with NVIDIA Graphics Card

If your system has an NVIDIA graphics card and you want to utilize GPU acceleration within Docker containers, you'll also need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit:

1. Follow the installation guide provided [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.
